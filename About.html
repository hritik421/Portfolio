            <h2> About me</h2>
            <p>
                üëã Greetings! I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a Software Engineer with a strong background in
                Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). My name is [Your Name], and I'm excited to share my skills and
                experiences with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                üéì I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in CSE, which has provided me with a solid foundation in
                various aspects of software development and computer systems. Throughout my academic journey, I gained
                proficiency in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                üíº As a professional, I had the privilege of working as a Full Stack Developer on a project for
                Microsoft. This experience honed my abilities to design and develop robust and scalable software
                solutions. Collaborating within a dynamic team, I contributed to the entire software development life
                cycle, from requirements gathering to deployment and maintenance.
            </p>
                üåê Additionally, I pursued my passion for teaching and served as a Teaching Assistant at Coding Ninja, a
                leading institution. During my four-month internship, I worked specifically with the Data Science and
                Machine Learning course. This opportunity allowed me to assist students in understanding complex coding
                concepts, facilitating their growth and learning journey.
            <p>
                üí° With my expertise in full stack development, proficiency in various programming languages, and
                knowledge of data science and machine learning, I bring a versatile skill set to the table. I thrive on
                solving challenges, writing efficient code, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and
                technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                üîç If you're seeking a dedicated and resourceful Software Engineer who can contribute to your team's
                success, I'm eager to explore potential opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss how my
                skills and experiences can be beneficial. Let's collaborate and create innovative software solutions
                together!
            </p>
